    A certificate can be verified by supplying its keys to this function.

    >>> pratts(1011235813471123581347, certificate.keys()) is not None
    True

    If the ``partial`` parameter is ``True``, then a partial certificate may
    be returned if a complete certificate could not be generated. In particular,
    any key ``p`` for which a prime factorization of ``p - 1`` could not be
    determined is associated with ``None`` in the certificate.

    {1011235813471123581347: None}

    When supplied an input that can be determined to be composite, ``None``
    is returned.

    True
    >>> pratts(6, [2, 5]) is None
    True

    If the supplied input does not contain sufficiently many primes to
    obtain all the prime factorizations necessary to build a certificate,
    then an exception is raised (which also specifies at least one example
    of a ``p - 1`` term that could not be factored).
